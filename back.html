        <h4>How to Perform</h4>
        <ol>
      <li>Set up for Wide-Grip Cable Row with a stable base, braced core, and aligned joints.</li>
      <li>Move through the working phase under control, directing tension to the lats and upper back.</li>

        <ol>
      <li>Set up for Back Extension (Hyperextension) with a stable base, braced core, and aligned joints.</li>
      <li>Move through the working phase under control, directing tension to the lats and upper back.</li>
      <li>Pause briefly at the end range without bouncing or losing position.</li>
      <li>Return to the start along the same path, keeping tempo smooth and repeat for target reps.</li>

      <div class="benefits">
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
      <li>Builds strength and hypertrophy in the lats and upper back.</li>
      <li>Engages the biceps, rear delts, forearms, spinal erectors for balanced development and stability.</li>
      <li>Improves joint control, movement efficiency, and training consistency.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mistakes">
        <h4>Common Mistakes</h4>
        <ul>
      <li>Using momentum instead of control—slow the eccentric and stay braced.</li>
      <li>Cutting range of motion—work through a comfortable full range for better stimulus.</li>
      <li>Letting joints misalign—keep neutral wrists, stacked elbows/shoulders, and stable posture.</li>
