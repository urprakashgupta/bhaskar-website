        <h2 class="section-heading">Building a Training Lifestyle, Not Just a 12-Week Plan</h2>
        <p class="section-subtext">Living a fit life is not only about one workout or one diet plan. It’s creating a lifestyle where training, recovery, nutrition, work, and rest all support each other.</p>
        <p class="meta">My journey from 92 kg to 68 kg taught me that real change comes from small, consistent decisions every day—how you train, how you eat, how you sleep, and how you manage stress.</p>
        <p class="meta">This Lifestyle section is built on evidence-based strength training principles: train with good form and smart programming, allow the body to recover and grow, maintain daily movement beyond gym sessions, and stay consistent for months and years.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">How Often Should You Train?</h2>
        <p class="section-subtext">Your weekly structure depends on your level and schedule. A realistic, book-style approach looks like this:</p>
        <h3>Beginner (2–3 days/week)</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>2–3 full body workouts.</li>
          <li>Focus on big compound movements (squat, press, row, hinge).</li>
          <li>1–2 rest days between training days.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intermediate (4 days/week)</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Upper / Lower split.</li>
          <li>Day 1 – Upper Body (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms).</li>
          <li>Day 2 – Lower Body (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves).</li>
          <li>Day 3 – Rest or light cardio.</li>
          <li>Day 4 – Upper Body.</li>
          <li>Day 5 – Lower Body.</li>
          <li>Day 6–7 – Rest or active recovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advanced (5–6 days/week)</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Push / Pull / Legs or body-part split.</li>
          <li>Each muscle gets 2× direct work per week.</li>
          <li>Intensity and volume are rotated intelligently.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="meta">The goal is not to train every day, it’s to recover enough so you can train hard on the days that matter.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Rules I Follow Inside the Gym</h2>
        <h3>Progressive Overload</h3>
        <p class="meta">Add a little weight, a few more reps, or better form over time. The body only grows when you challenge it gradually.</p>
        <h3>Form First, Ego Later</h3>
        <p class="meta">Quality reps beat heavy sloppy reps. Good technique protects your joints and hits the muscle better.</p>
        <h3>Warm-Up Properly</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>3–5 minutes light movement (walk or cycle).</li>
          <li>1–2 warm-up sets for the first main lift.</li>
          <li>Shoulder/hip mobility on heavy days.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Train Major Muscle Groups</h3>
        <p class="meta">Do not skip legs, back, or rear delts. A balanced physique is stronger, healthier, and more resistant to injury.</p>
        <h3>Keep a Training Log</h3>
        <p class="meta">Note exercises, sets, reps, and how you felt. This is your roadmap for progression.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Growth Happens When You Rest</h2>
        <p class="meta">Your muscles don’t grow in the gym. They grow when you sleep, eat, and recover.</p>
        <h3>Key habits</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep most nights.</li>
          <li>Sleep and wake at roughly the same time (for me: 10 PM to 4:30 AM).</li>
          <li>Keep your room dark, cool, and quiet.</li>
          <li>Avoid heavy screen time right before bed.</li>
          <li>Plan rest days—they are part of the program, not a sign of weakness.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Signs you might need more recovery</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Constant fatigue.</li>
          <li>No progress in lifts.</li>
          <li>Nagging aches and pains.</li>
          <li>No motivation to train.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">It’s Not Just About the 1-Hour Workout</h2>
        <p class="section-subtext">Training hard for one hour and then sitting for 12 hours is not true fitness.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Try to hit 7,000–10,000 steps a day (depending on your level).</li>
          <li>Move every 45–60 minutes (small walk or stretch).</li>
          <li>Take stairs when possible.</li>
          <li>Stand and walk while taking some calls.</li>
          <li>Add 1–2 light walks after meals when you can.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="meta">These small habits improve circulation, digestion, fat loss, and recovery.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Eating to Support Training</h2>
        <p class="section-subtext">High-level food habits; full diet details are in the Diet tab.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Focus on whole, minimally processed food.</li>
          <li>Get enough protein daily (especially as a vegetarian).</li>
          <li>Plan meals around training: Pre-workout light carbs + some protein; Post-workout protein + carbs.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated throughout the day.</li>
          <li>Avoid extreme crash diets and instant transformation promises.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="meta">Fitness lifestyle means eating in a way you can follow for years, not weeks.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Balancing Gym, Office, and Life</h2>
        <p class="meta">I work as an Accounts Manager and still train early morning. My lifestyle must support both my job and my training.</p>
        <h3>Key mindset rules</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>No excuses—even on busy days, do something (shorter session, walk, mobility).</li>
          <li>Plan tomorrow’s training today so you do not waste time in the gym.</li>
          <li>Accept slow progress—1% better every day is enough.</li>
          <li>Don’t compare your journey with others; focus on your level and pace.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stress-management habits</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Short walks.</li>
          <li>Breathing breaks.</li>
          <li>Limited negative screen time.</li>
          <li>Use the gym as a positive outlet, not punishment.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">My Personal Lifestyle Rules</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Move every day—gym, walk, mobility, something.</li>
          <li>Train with purpose—do not copy random workouts.</li>
          <li>Fuel your body—don’t starve it.</li>
          <li>Sleep like it’s a priority.</li>
          <li>Stay natural and patient—no shortcuts.</li>
          <li>Let fitness fit your life, not fight your life.</li>
