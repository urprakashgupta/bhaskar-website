        <ul>
      <li>Builds strength and hypertrophy in the gastrocnemius and soleus.</li>
      <li>Engages the feet/ankle stabilizers for balanced development and stability.</li>
      <li>Improves joint control, movement efficiency, and training consistency.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mistakes">
        <h4>Common Mistakes</h4>
        <ul>
      <li>Using momentum instead of control—slow the eccentric and stay braced.</li>
      <li>Cutting range of motion—work through a comfortable full range for better stimulus.</li>
      <li>Letting joints misalign—keep neutral wrists, stacked elbows/shoulders, and stable posture.</li>

      <li>Move through the working phase under control, directing tension to the gastrocnemius and soleus.</li>
      <li>Pause briefly at the end range without bouncing or losing position.</li>
      <li>Return to the start along the same path, keeping tempo smooth and repeat for target reps.</li>
